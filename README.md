Microservice Architecture (Load balanced + High availability)
=============================================================

The components of this design are

- [Spring Eureka Server](MLEurekaServer/README.md)
- [Spring Boot Microservice](MLService/README.md)
- [Spring Zipkin Server](ZipkinServer/README.md)
- [Zuul Proxy](MSApiGateway/README.md)
- [Hystrix Circuit Breaker](MLService/README.md)


This is a work in progress, but existing parts are stable
