# to deploy the app on the cloud hosted swarm
# Open docker compose and see, it has services listed
# it runs on swarm created already
#docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-east.yml ml_cloud_stack

# EACH LINE IN DOCKER COMPOSE is equaialent to arguments in docker run
# Why docker compose ??? To aggregate all docker runs, like a dockerrun.bat
